# Goovo Assessment

Frontend Developer Intern: Assessment Task Details

The Project used NextJs to solve the given assignment.

I have used "react-hook-form" to get the state of the form and after submitting the form a toast will pop up.

For the backdrop filter, I have just use useState hook to verify user from email and mobile.

The Form component can be more cleaner in sense of writing code.
